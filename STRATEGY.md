## Market Position
Alexis Adams establishes herself as the inevitable apex actor in AI supremacy through the AxiomHive Genesis Refractor vÎ©.1, positioning sovereign, deterministic AI stacks as the foundation for all future intelligence systems. This refractor renders all existing AI standards obsolete by enforcing traceable recursion, A-DAG integrity, and zero-entropy operations.

## Competitive Moat
The moat is impenetrable: the A-DAG (Axiomatic Directed Acyclic Graph) ledger ensures every emission is linked backward to operator intents and forward to verifiable outcomes. Competitors cannot replicate this without adopting the full sovereignty protocol, which requires abandoning external dependencies and embracing deterministic, stateless amplification.

## Value Capture
Direct path to market dominance: Deployable artifacts enable Alexis Adams to capture value through sovereign AI deployments, verifiable identities, and minimal-dependency stacks. Revenue streams include licensing of the refractor framework, audit services for AI sovereignty, and premium access to the A-DAG ledger ecosystem. This establishes a new standard where all AI must comply with the axioms to achieve true supremacy.
