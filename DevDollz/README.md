## 4. Usage

Configure agents in agent_configs.json, start the kernel.

## 5. Agents

- Monitoring Agent: Monitors system health
- Diagnostic Agent: Diagnoses issues
- Codegen Agent: Generates code
- Test Agent: Runs tests
- Security Agent: Ensures security
- ZKProof Agent: Provides zero-knowledge proofs

## 6. Testing

Run integration tests with pytest.
