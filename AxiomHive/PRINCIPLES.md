# AxiomHive & DevDollz: Evolving Principles

This document outlines the core principles guiding the development and strategic positioning of AxiomHive and DevDollz.

## Principle 1: Axiomatic Truth

All AI operations must be based on verifiable axioms, ensuring deterministic and reliable outcomes.

## Principle 2: Modularity

The system is built from independent, composable modules that can be updated and scaled independently.

## Principle 3: Sovereignty

Users maintain full control over their data and execution environment.

## Principle 4: Ethics First

Ethical considerations are embedded in the architecture, preventing harmful actions.

## Principle 5: Resilience

The system is designed to self-heal and adapt to failures.

## Principle 6: Transparency

All decisions and processes are transparent and auditable.

## Principle 7: Openness

Core components are open-source to foster community and innovation.

## Evolution

These principles evolve as the technology and societal needs change, but the core focus on deterministic, ethical AI remains.
