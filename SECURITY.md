## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in AxiomWarxp, please report it responsibly. We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our sovereign AI platform secure.

### How to Report

1. **Do not create public issues** for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security@axiomhive.com with details
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact on sovereignty/determinism
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours of receiving your report
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and provide regular updates
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue promptly
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you

## Security Considerations

### Sovereignty Impact
Security vulnerabilities are classified by their impact on AI sovereignty:

- **Critical**: Compromises determinism or introduces external dependencies
- **High**: Affects A-DAG integrity or GitHub synchronization
- **Medium**: Impacts performance or reliability
- **Low**: Minor issues with limited impact

### Zero-Trust Architecture
AxiomWarxp implements a zero-trust security model:

- No implicit trust between components
- All communications are authenticated and encrypted
- Minimal attack surface through stateless design
- Cryptographic verification of all artifacts

### Threat Model

#### External Threats
- Platform dependency injection
- Determinism compromise
- A-DAG ledger tampering
- GitHub synchronization hijacking

#### Internal Threats
- Entropy drift introduction
- Metamorphic capability abuse
- Sovereign operation bypass
- Kernel panic exploitation

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- Never introduce external API dependencies
- Maintain deterministic behavior in all code
- Use cryptographic hashing for integrity checks
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Test security implications of changes

### For Users
- Deploy in isolated environments
- Verify artifact hashes before deployment
- Monitor entropy levels continuously
- Keep dependencies minimal and vetted
- Use sovereign operation modes exclusively

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Automated entropy monitoring
- A-DAG integrity validation
- GitHub synchronization verification
- Kernel panic detection

### Containment
- Automatic rollback to genesis state
- Isolation of compromised components
- Entropy threshold enforcement
- Sovereign operation lockdown

### Recovery
- Genesis refractor reset
- A-DAG ledger reconstruction
- GitHub state reconciliation
- Metamorphic architecture healing
